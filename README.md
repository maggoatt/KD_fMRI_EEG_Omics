# Multimodal Knowledge Distillation for Alertness State Classification

The purpose of the overall project is to develop an EEG-to-fMRI knowledge distillation pipeline with an EEG transformer teacher model and fMRI graph neural network (GNN) student model. Omics-level information is used to further inform the knowledge distillation pipeline, i.e. inform the fMRI GNN on what ROIs to focus on.
